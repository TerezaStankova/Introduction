# Hello World!

About me: I am a top student of Information systems and technology from Czech Republic. I am a recipient of Android Nanodegree Scholarship from Google and Udacity. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence (my minor) and Finance. I love board games, reading (especially fantasy - Harry Potter, GoT and Terry Pratchett), programming, music (while programming), films (Marvel) and math :) Volunteering is another of my passions (I am part of CoderDojo community - teaching children to code). I spent one semester in South Korea and one in Austria. 

Have a wonderful day :)

Tereza
